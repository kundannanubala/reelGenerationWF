Avida offers the opposite. The Avida way of life is about wanting more, not less. After a busy life of building success, wealth and families, it is about embracing the excitement of shifting to a new chapter. It is about spending your later years thriving in a holistic, safe community of like-minded, young-at-heart people, that prioritizes wellness, arts and culture and travel. Avida is about making the most of your best years in a vibrant environment that fosters innovation, independence and inspiration. To be in the know about all things Avida, sign up below.",

Today there are more than 1,250 restaurants open across the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, UK and the United Arab Emirates.  Wingstop quickly became a fan favorite when we first opened our doors in 1994. Our proprietary recipes, outstanding food and superior customer service created a demand that could only be satisfied by more locations. And in 1997 we began offering franchises. Today we are one of the fastest-growing concepts in the country, attracting top entrepreneurs and operators with the drive and passion to own their own business.  OVER 20 YEARS OF FLAVOR Since setting up shop in '94, we've been putting flavor first. And we're not about to stop. We're all about taking our wings to another level, saucing and tossing the freshest flavors you crave along the way.  OUR MISSION: TO SERVE THE WORLD FLAVOR We're not in the wing business. We're in the flavor business. It's been our mission to serve the world flavor since we first opened shop in '94, and we're just getting started.  1997 saw the opening of our first franchised Wingstop location, and by 2002 we had served the world one billion wings. It's flavor that defines us and has made Wingstop one of the fastest growing brands in the restaurant industry.  Wingstop is the destination when you crave fresh never faked wings, hand-cut seasoned fries and any of our famous sides. For people who demand flavor in everything they do, there's only Wingstop - because it's more than a meal, it's a flavor experience.",

Ikhlaq also co-founded Zayn BitRate Fund with Faisal Aftab (Managing Partner). A leading VC fund active in Pakistan, BitRate gives shape to their combined vision of funding, supporting, and developing the new, inspired generation of entrepreneurs that will drive Pakistan’s growth story. Given the success of the fund and its impact on the ecosystem, Hayaat plans to launch a venture-focused division which will support promising VC managers in other emerging and frontier markets as well.  This entrepreneurial zeal has been built atop sound academic and professional credentials.

With a vast experience in financial services vertical and carefully cultivated relationships across geographies, I decided to start my entrepreneurial journey in 2021 after my last employment with a fund services company based out of Bahrain. As its CEO, my mandate was to expand its fund services business in the Middle East. Now I have taken up a role of full time Director and SEO of a venture capital fund based out of DIFC, Dubai and a non-executive director of Moebius Management Solutions, a management consulting firm mentoring and advising start-ups. I have also been involved with large scale strategic planning exercises and change management initiatives in my previous jobs. The recognitions from MENA Fund Manager, a leading industry publication and Forbes Middle East bring in significant brand value to the organizations I have been part of. Being a Marshall Goldsmith certified Leadership and Team Coach helps in mentoring the ambitious start-ups scale new heights and its leaders and teams become more successful.",

We finance inventions and innovations in blockchain, 3D printing, and genomics, and new technologies in life sciences to allow people to live longer and to be healthy and productive throughout their lives.  And we’re just getting started. We are financing a company that manufactures self-driving, hydrogen-powered drones, planes, and rockets and another company to manufacture high-performance hydrogen-powered sports cars and trucks.  We are financing a company that will work to cure cancer through genomics and one that will automate the workforce through robotics.  We are financing a company to manufacture hydrogen-powered ships, and another to build the next generation of trains.  Another company aims to manufacture replacement organs for humans, while yet another will create meat without killing animals.  If that sounds crazy then that is good, for we believe that if your dreams don’t sound crazy, then they are not big enough, and not worth having. ",

A new Board of Directors was appointed, chaired by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz, Chairman of CEDA.  Vision and Objectives  The Public Investment Fund aims to be a global investment powerhouse and the world’s most impactful investor, enabling the creation of new sectors and opportunities that will shape the future global economy, while driving the economic transformation of Saudi Arabia.  Portfolio  The Public Investment Fund has a diverse portfolio made up of a significant number of investments, of which around 20 are listed on the Tadawul, the Saudi Stock Exchange.

As of January 2023, Ligo Partners’ global platform co-invests with 2,455 domestic and international family offices and qualified investors with a combined net worth of $224 billion who are interested in non-traditional, market-uncorrelated technology investment opportunities that (a) are not easily found (think Uber at seed); and (b) have shown resilience to recent changes in the recent macroeconomic environment.  Our investment team sources 90+ potential investments each month with an important selection criteria: the deal is led by a top venture capitalist or an investor in the Ligo family office community. Hence, 100% of our deal flow is warmly referred, often proprietary and mostly off-market.  Our investment committee then selectively curates top 7 direct equity and venture debt investments showcased via a highly time-efficient 45 min curated deals monthly webinar.",

But what I find just as impressive is the collective intelligence we can harness - and progress we can make - by bringing brains together.  This is why I love cultivating connection, collaboration & learning between people from different backgrounds, industries & cultures, and fueling the right conditions for serendipity, synergy & inspiration to emerge. Because cross-pollination isn’t just good for plants - it’s good for ideas, innovation, and ultimately business.

OVO's first-check portfolio includes the likes of Wish (NASDAQ: WISH), Sourcegraph (DevOps, $2B+), Addepar (Fintech, $2B+), Everlaw (SaaS Legal, $2B+), and Signifyd (Fintech, $1.3B+).   As an investor, Gianfranco applies his expertise in nurturing teams building emergent technologies, and maintaining conviction long when the hype and frenzy have died down. His investment focus is primarily centered around financial technology, artificial intelligence (LLMs/autonomous agents), and decentralized systems. His investment approach revolves around backing pioneering infrastructure technologies and enabling the shift from current digital platforms to up-and-coming innovations.  Before venture investing, Gianfranco was a TMT investment banker at Barclays Capital in Menlo Park. Previous internship experience includes stints at McKinsey & Company, Goldman Sachs, and Matrix Partners.   Gianfranco actively writes about technologies at the bleeding edge at https://filice.beehiiv.com, focusing on applying a first-principles approach. Gianfranco's approach to writing is demonstrated by the following: \"Write to be useful, not to sound smart. The harder people have to work to understand what you've written, the less they'll want your input.\"   When Gianfranco is not spending his time investing, he volunteers as a business mentor for SCORE's San Francisco Chapter. Gianfranco graduated with a degree in economics from Stanford University. He is conversationally proficient in Italian. He is a first-generation American and the first in his family to attend college. ",

The Group offers investors the opportunity to invest in high calibre debt deals to make market beating returns on their investments.  Huddle works to achieve fair returns for investors whilst also to provide support to UK businesses, which haven’t been given the finance to grow. By connecting the two together, businesses are given the opportunity to thrive, and investors access to attractive returns on their savings.  We only want to offer investors highly curated lending opportunities, with this in mind we have a stringent assessment process in place for our loans. Some of the core features we look at when accessing and approving a loan, are the following:  Security & Collateral The quality of the underlying loans we make are enhanced by using tangible assets (usually property) as security. We work within strict parameters and a maximum LTV of 75%, with the majority of loans falling beneath that threshold.  Short - Medium Term Maturity Our loans typically range from 6 to 24 months. Short-medium term financing is naturally self-liquidating, as there are multiple take-outs due to the variation of underlying loan terms. This ensures loan capital is regularly returned to investors.  Exit We prefer to fund borrowers that have a clearly defined exit strategy. This allows us to control cashflow and manage repayment expectations as well as assess the credit risk of each borrower.  Investors chose their preferred structure with us of either:  Syndicated Loan Structures Where we offer High Net Worth & Sophisticated investors the opportunity to directly participate in the larger deals that we underwrite, through our syndicated loan structures.  Managed Investment Bond The perfect investment product for hands-off investors, combining high returns with high security, in a hassle free manner.  Find your next investment opportunity with Huddle Capital today!",

Connection Policy: I *freely but only* connect on LinkedIn with people I have voluntarily spoken with for more than a few minutes in real-time (F2F, phone, Zoom, whatever).  I never \"follow\" companies etc.  So it's not personal!  Contact Policy: Just email me!  I am terrible at keeping up with LinkedIn.  rlucas@saas-capital.com.  I'm also exceptionally easy (maybe too easy) to get a hold of if you make reasonable efforts.  Previously: - Started the Canadian investing practice for Voyager Capital, the Pacific NW B2B first-round VC. - Built the premier source of risk data on the building industry in the Northwest, at Simple Verity, and sold it. - Was employee #1 and head of finance for a startup specialty finance company, Lighter Capital (formerly RevenueLoan). - Advised (and learned from) CEOs and executives at the board level across a range of (early) company stages. - Helped invest and manage $420M AUM at Voyager Capital, a traditional VC focusing on early stage IT. - Started a \"dorm-room dot-com,\" led it to profitability, and sold it.   Things I actually have been getting paid to do more recently: Private debt and equity (venture capital) deal sourcing; investment diligence and negotiation; writing term sheets; closing of equity, debt, revenue-based, and convertible rounds.  Financial modeling and analysis; complex private company capital structures; private company valuation.  Fun technical/entrepreneurial things I once did:  Machine learning in applied fintech domains; applying sparse and non-traditional data to financial, credit, and risk decisions.  Startup company formation (incorporation and seed funding); new product marketing / positioning; new product development (management and launch).  Web software (from OS to JS), databases, agile languages.",

The aforementioned has led to extensive experience in investment banking, business operations, and board work.  Jared’s involvement has helped produce over $5B of invested capital with >45 exits, including companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Lyft, Airbnb, Spotify, Alibaba, DocuSign, Coinbase, DraftKings, Asana, MoneyLion, and Palantir.

We are pioneers in this space and have collectively engaged in more than $10B of primary and secondary venture investments. Our belief is that Direct Secondaries are the evolution of the Secondary LP investing strategy established in the early 1980s and should be treated accordingly.  MVP differentiates itself through its unique research and ability to streamline the secondary process by being a principal investing and advisory solution to private companies and their shareholders, as well as GPs and LPs. This is accomplished by bringing together the full expertise of our Secondary as a Service platform, investment banking expertise, research team, and the All-Star Family of funds with >$1B of AUM.  The team at Manhattan Venture Research was the first to produce research on private technology companies. MVR provides insight for investors in the form of unbiased, cutting-edge private company research. These reports have the benefit of alleviating the opacity and informational asymmetry that comes with the venture capital asset class. The reports that MVR produce is akin to when traditional investment banks initiate coverage on public companies, except our universe is exclusively private. We were the first to initiate coverage on Spotify, Palantir, SpaceX, Uber, and Airbnb.  Our Secondary as a Service™ team structures programmatic liquidity solutions in collaboration with the company, where we act as an advisor, investor, and/or book runner.

I led product at Zappos, aligning the growth of the web and mobile products to our business goals. As the primary link between the business teams and technology, our team oversaw the launch of our mobile products, our first non-core shopping experiences and the launch of our VIP program.   In 2011 our CEO, Tony Hsieh, asked me to lead the development of our 6.5 acre downtown Las Vegas campus resulting in a LEED Gold rehab of the former Las Vegas City Hall.  Tony and I launched a separate company, Downtown Project, investing $350M across 40+ acres of downtown Las Vegas focused on real estate development, small business investment, startup ecosystem cultivation and arts/culture. During that time I also founded two companies, one in coworking and one in advanced urban mobility.  We later formed VTF Capital, a $50M+ seed fund, to invest in retail technologies and long-term retail brands, where I was and remain Managing Partner, although we are no longer making new investments.  In 2018 I joined Pilotworks, an NYC-based operator of shared commercial kitchens and services for food companies in six states, as COO and later CEO to lead a turnaround.

      "Notes": "Imperfect. But highly skilled. I build businesses because I'm unemployable. I love learning and I try to spend as much time talking to business leaders and practitioners alike. Talk is cheap and bullshit walks.  In 2006 I got my first exposure to what’s now known as ‘Startups’ and fell in love. Over the next 3 years I grabbed as much sweat equity as possible, had my first successful exit and subsequently went on a tear starting my own businesses. Across the next decade+ I had another 4 successful exists, culminating in 2021 with the sale of LeadMD to private equity.   Meanwhile, I had started my own angel investing fund in 2018 and began making strategic investments in founders I believe in. Similarly, I also came on as a Limited Partner  in Stage 2 Capital, focusing on early-growth-stage ventures.  What those investing experiences taught me were two fold - VC fund models don’t serve investors particularly well - and Founders need far more than capital to grow.   As a result I co-founded In Revenue Capital in 2023, which couples GTM expertise with capital to empower founders and their startups with what they need to scale. We operate under an SPV model we believe avoids the pitfalls of “fund dynamics”and provides both ourselves as well as investors, freedom. We call this ‘Operator-Immersive Capital’, and we’re on a mission to fix venture capital for the better.   To round out my plate, and focus on a different kind of growth, my father and I own and operate a 130+ acre USDA Certified Organic Hemp farm in rural Missouri. We are pioneering the resurgence of the ‘new cotton’, which is a complete misnomer as hemp is one of the oldest crops on earth. We are one of the first certified organic hemp field growers to focus on the CBG cannabinoid, an innovative genetic cannabis strain with very real health benefits.   In addition to all of the above, I love the written word. In 2008 I left my job as a VP of Marketing and Sales in a small niche industry with almost no personal brand or platform. Today I've become a recognized speaker and author published hundreds of times in top publications. In 2017 I started my very own column, 'Tribal Leadership', in Inc. Magazine.   My wife Jennifer, son Grayson, and daughter Declan, are the reasons I work as if their lives depend on it.",

At the end of the day, VC’s are financiers. But Founders and Startups need more than Capital, they need expertise that drives results.  We know this, because we are Founders. Operators. Go-to-Market experts. We’ve sat in the same seats building, growing and exiting businesses of our own while also consulting for thousands of the top mid-market and enterprise companies.  We believe it’s unacceptable to see 92% of Founders as a write off.  That’s why we created In Revenue. The first operator-immersive capital firm.",

      "Notes": "Former military officer -> to venture capitalist -> to startups senior exec -> to Founder & CEO thru a successful acquisition -> GM at a Fortune 200 company as part of the acquisition -> Investor and Advisor  Prior to starting R-Squared Ventures, I was the Co-Founder and CEO of Loop Commerce, a company disrupting fintech, retail and commerce with its multi-patented and award-winning GiftNow® technology and service, working with top tier enterprise customers and partners. I started Loop in 2012, raised $30 million from tier-1 industry leaders, scaled it thru the acquisition by Synchrony in mid-2018, and continued to run the company as a wholly owned subsidiary as CEO and as a GM and SVP with Synchrony until departing in mid-2020.  As an active early stage investor, I love partnering with awesome start-up founders and CEOs. Supporting them by sharing my experience, beliefs and mantras as they face their own challenges and opportunities.  Topics of focus with CEOs include: the art of storytelling, and how to use it with fund raising, sales and business development, and internally with employees and BoD; sales and partnerships - breaking into C-level and decision makers, from pre-seed to growth; the chess game of a go-to-market strategy - throughout the various lifecycle stages; product strategy – MVP to scale; how to go about company hires and culture.  Categories include (but not limited to): fintech, digital commerce, enterprise SaaS – corporate to SMBs, retail, platforms, and solutions targeting B2B/B2C/B2B2C.   I have a passion for innovation. Bringing to market and growing great products and businesses, especially those disrupting and creating new categories. A believer in getting things done – knowing that at any given phase there are challenges to overcome (or better yet, get ahead of) that require a vision, mission, passion, drive, strategy, incredible storytelling, and creativity, alongside a strong, purpose driven team and culture - to make it big.",

UAB is acknowledged as an established, leading financial solutions provider to the growing commercial and industrial base across the UAE. The legal form of the Bank was converted to a public joint  stock company pursuant to Emiri Decree No. 17/82 issued by His Highness the Ruler of the Emirate of Sharjah on 29th July 1982. On 21st March 2005, the Bank’s issued share capital was listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.  UAB offers its customers a comprehensive suite of Corporate and Institutional Banking services supported by Trade Finance, Retail Banking and Treasury services, in addition to Islamic Banking solutions, thus positioning the Bank as the partner of choice among major corporate clientele segments.   As at 31st December 2015 the Bank was ranked 11th amongst listed banks in the UAE in terms of market capitalization.  In December 2007, UAB became part of a banking alliance upon the acquisition of 40% interest by The Commercial Bank, Qatar's largest private sector bank. UAB's strong financial performance in subsequent years is indicative of the benefits gleaned from its strategic alliance with the Qatari Bank. The Commercial Bank has similar alliances with National Bank of Oman (NBO) and Alternatifbank in Turkey, thus providing a solid platform for all three banks to grow strongly as we move forward.  The Bank is rated Baa2 by Moody's with Stable Outlook.",

      "Description": "Born with sustainability at the core of its operations, Keel Comms is the first and only purpose-driven PR & Communications, Social Media & Content agency in the Middle East and North Africa region. Founded by a group of passionate publicists and social media experts with an unshakeable belief that Purpose Relations is the new Public Relations, Keel is designed to create shared value for governments, businesses and communities alike.  Our focus is to primarily serve those government bodies, enterprises, SMEs, startups and public figures whose work is rooted in purpose. While not all entities or individuals have a knack for sustainability, we strive to imprint a corporate citizenship mindset in our clients’ DNA. Whether at the inception, early or maturity phase, we advise clients on how to incorporate Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) factors into their operations and branding so that we can help them communicate their efforts genuinely. “Without wisdom, wealth is worthless. At midlife when wisdom starts to shine through, you realize that human endeavor is not meaningful unless it is married to purpose. Fulfilment is a feeling you get when you serve others and feel you are part of something bigger than yourself,” Baha Hamadi, Founder & Managing Director. For businesses with no ESG activities, we recommend ways in which they can contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), either through co-creating initiatives or by facilitating partnerships with other entities within our network. For non-profits whose values align with ours, we offer discounted fees.  Considering the growing ESG movement globally, we aim to empower brands and individuals to play an active role during the Decade of Action and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by 2030.",

It’s hard to know where the investment is used and it’s difficult to track long term impact and guarantees.  Preservation is a must.

My greatest interest is to lead new strategies and work on new ideas and platforms that do not yet exist in the market but will soon take their place as emerging technologies and present new investment opportunities.  I am honored to be the leader and chief architect of the new category and discipline of venture capital called, “Venture Science”.   Venture Science is a new and tested multi-disciplinary field that uses validated scientific methodologies to make objective, and unbiased analysis of business practices and outcomes.    I believe that Venture Science technology is the next generation paradigm shift of an industry long awaiting its own evolution.  With years of C-Suite experience in start-up and emerging growth companies, in both technology and biotech, within the angel and venture capital industry, I understand first-hand both the investors perspective, and entrepreneurs pain points of starting, funding, and building an enterprise class company to full realization.  I gained invaluable experience as a founder/operator, early stage investor, and syndicator.  Disciplines include business development, operations, sales, marketing, management and publishing, in addition to capital formation and board building.   My history and why   Starting and funding one of Southern California’s first Internet service providers (ISP) in 1993, I was frustrated with the absence of any meaningful local start-up venture community ecosystem.  As a response, in 1997 I formed the Tech Coast name and brand with the objective of attracting capital and talent, creating visibility, and forming a united tech community initiative that spanned from Santa Barbara to San Diego.  The Tech Coast, and the Tech Coast Initiative was born, elevating the region from not ranked to ranked #3, for total venture capital dollars deployed by region in just 4 years. See Tech Coast below.   I am grateful to the thousands that made the Tech Coast such a success, and so well recognized.  Together we’ll continue to build our venture community ecosystem and the technologies that enable them.     Sincerely  Chip F. Parker    PS. Join us in the paradigm shift of Venture Science. Please reach out to me cparker@labxventures.com and put Venture Science in the subject line    ",

      "Notes": "I'm a tech entrepreneur and angel investor in Silicon Valley. Most recently, I was Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Signalfire, a $1.8B VC fund. I love advising and investing in the next generation of startup founders.  I had a blast building startups from my college dorm room, working at Linkedin for a few years, building a Future of Work+AI company (scaled to clients like Splunk, Twitter, Logitech, Coca-Cola), building a healthcare company (scaled to 6M users, ~100 employees; backed by General Catalyst CEO), working with various VC funds and mentoring over 300+ startups globally. The best parts were the people along my journey and the personal growth they inspired in me.   To pay it forward, I founded Go Against the Flow in 2013 to educate 1 million women to take risks and build their own businesses. I published a book and produced a documentary film that was screened all around the world – from the Empire State building in New York to the National Gallery of Singapore. I also produced educational documentary films such as Real Moms of Silicon Valley on working mothers (screened at 1k+ locations across 75 countries) and I Want to Believe (featuring resilient founders of Tesla, Gitlab etc.).   I also enjoy giving keynotes and workshops on entrepreneurship, finding one's purpose, career growth and leadership, and artificial intelligence. I've done over 600 talks and panels over the years, and hosted & spoken at 3 TEDx conferences. I especially love sharing my passion for risk-taking and living a life of congruence.   Some recognitions: AI entrepreneur of the year by VentureBeat, Top 10 Woman in Cloud by Sheryl Sandberg and Cloud-now, Power Woman alongside Oprah & Melinda Gates, Forbes 30 Under 30 alum.   Media features: CNET, Techcrunch, Forbes, Inc, Yahoo! Finance, ABC7, Huffington Post, Venture Beat, Business Insider among others.   Education: BA in Physics & Economics from Mount Holyoke College, Executive MBA from Booth School of Business at UChicago.  Fun fact: In 2003, my brother and I were awarded the National Bravery Award by the Prime Minister of India for fighting with goons in a train robbery and saving lives of women, making us ‘national heroes’ overnight. I became an advocate for self-defense training for women, and went on to earn black-belts in Karate and Taekwondo, and represented India in South Korea. The education board dedicated chapters to us in the 10th grade English textbook and the 9th grade Hindi textbook in high schools in Maharashtra, India.I went to all 7 continents and wrote a travel memoir during my college years.",

      "Notes": "Lifelong technologist, entrepreneur and philosopher. Investor too.  Regarding startups, two of my core beliefs are:  1) Most good ideas are not also good businesses.  It is job ONE of an early entrepreneur to figure out if their good idea might also be a good business. The most-reliable path to this objective is identifying, quantifying and verifying all of the assumptions that founders make (or don't make but should). Based on those validated assumptions, if an entrepreneur cannot tell a cogent story about how how their idea can grow to become a good business... then don't quit your job.     2) It takes a village to raise a startup.  To that end, I am active in the startup community as an advisor, mentor and organizer.  I founded Startup Haven in 2006 as a means of connecting venture-scale startup founders with the help they need.  Specialties: startup anatomist, business model aficionado, technology maven, paladin-class software engineer, philosopher (no, really)",

I like playing with the latest and greatest technology, but my greatest thrills come from applying that into new situations where anyone can use it without understanding the tech. You know you've succeeded when your neighbors tell you about the latest thing they've discovered... and you've worked on it. Most important to me is finding an amazing group of talented people to share the journey with.   I have been lucky to be a part of several of the most significant internet and social companies and led or was involved in key projects that have altered their trajectories. I held early product, growth, and platform roles at LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter including launching LinkedIn Jobs, Facebook Connect, and leading Twitter's early relevance efforts such as trends and user recommendations. More recently, I led the product, marketing, and design teams at Robinhood as we more than doubled the userbase, revenue, and the team in 2018-19.  I've also spent many years at Greylock as a General Partner where I led series A and B investments and served on the board of the next wave of social products including Discord, Musical.ly (now Tiktok), Medium, and more.",

With the traditional business plan method, everything happens inside an incubator/accelerator where there is little knowledge. We do it the other way around: instead of writing a business plan (documenting all unknowns) or executing a predefined theoretical plan, we spend most of our time outside the building to uncover the unknowns by talking to customers, partners, etc. We focus on customer validation and MVP instead of developing a product or executing a predefined business plan. In fact we will never develop \"the final\" product but rather constantly improving the previous version. This is not another or new approach in entrepreneurship, but rather a fundamental different approach in how to successfully start a business”. Ahmed Abdulwahab",

I have over 25 years of business development and investing experience spanning hardware, software, and services, across four continents. Angel investments include Carta and Eargo (IPO).  Several of my portfolio companies have had successful IPOs on the Nasdaq and NYSE, with others acquired by Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, SAP, Yahoo, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Cox Automotive, Keynote Systems, Ericsson, Assa Abloy, Toro, Digital Island, ITXC, Cable & Wireless, and CNH Industrial.  Prior to joining HCVC in 2017, I led Western Digital’s North American and European strategic venturing program at Western Digital Capital.  I came to WDC via its acquisition of SanDisk, where I led investments in North America for SanDisk Ventures. Before SanDisk I was the VP in charge of venture-backed supply chain startup PCH International’s emerging business team targeting startups, where I co-founded Highway 1, a hardware startup accelerator between San Francisco and Shenzhen. Earlier, I headed France Telecom-Orange’s venture activities in the US, investing on behalf of Innovacom as well as France Telecom Technology Investments and Orange Ventures.  I’m a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University in Information & Decision Systems as well as Policy & Management, and started my computing industry career while a student, serving as Campus Representative for Apple Computer.  I enjoy working with companies that can have a profound impact on their ecosystem. The companies I've been involved with have pioneered significant advances in the Internet, computing, mobile, and consumer electronics industries.  I've used online services since the days of acoustic coupler modems, have worked with Internet technologies since 1989, and mobile systems since 1993.  I have a multicultural background, having lived in the US, Norway, Brazil, France, Scotland, England, China, and Singapore, and conducted business in a significant number of other countries across Asia, Europe, and the Americas.  I have substantial experience with public speaking, conference presentations, and working with the media. Over the years I've been interviewed and referenced by US National Public Radio, Private Equity Week, The Corporate Venturing Report, Global Corporate Venturing, Upside Magazine, Tele.Com Magazine, La Tribune, Le Point, Red Herring, Fortune Small Business, DotCEO Magazine, Tornado Insider, The Industry Standard, and Venture Reporter, among others.",

When they succeed, they generate returns that in turn support Index’s investors, including non-profit foundations; education, healthcare and research endowments; and other impact-driven organizations.

Women bore an immense burden during this time, balancing work, parenting, and household duties. At 20Fund, we believe that women are capable of doing it all, and they merit more support.    Acting as a catalyst for Italian female disruptors, we're hands-on and collaboratively focused on investing in pre-seed and seed stage, sustainability-focused, female founded companies headquartered in Italy.   From funding, mentoring, and sharing resources and community connections, we provide idea-to-exit support and solutions for female founders so they may grow their businesses while also maximizing their impact.",

      "Description": "We are developing a minimally invasive, mechanical blood circulatory device, known as a ventricular assist device (LVAD) for heart failure (HF) patients. By disrupting the current LVAD paradigm, we aspire to significantly reduce heart failure treatment costs while dramatically improving clinical outcomes as well as the quality and length of life for patients. Our CEO, Dr. Sudhir Kushwaha is a thought leader in this space, as the Medical Director of the Cardiac Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support Program at the Mayo Clinic. The Company was born from Sudhir’s experience in managing his team that perform heart transplants and provide circulatory therapy to patients including LVAD implantation. He took a radically different approach in LVAD design in an effort to eliminate the shortcomings of the currently available LVADs, which now share a US$1 billion and growing market. Our principal design goals were to achieve: (i) minimally invasive, reversible implantation; (our pump is placed in the aorta above the aortic valve); (ii) full synchronized pulsatility to minimize known clinical adverse side effects and supplement natural heart function (pump failure need not result in mortality); (iii) efficacy as an LVAD, RVAD or BiVAD solution; and (iv) a fully implanted system, without external wires, charged through the skin. We have completed the prototype development of our MI-VADTM device, which has undergone preliminary “proof of concept” testing in a live animal model. We have acquired issued patents in the US, Europe and China and have other patent filings worldwide in progress, which will secure maximum protection for our inventions. We are continuing the development of our device through technical refinement and system integration, together with additional animal studies leading to a design freeze in preparation for preliminary human implantation.  We have assembled a world-class team of medical and engineering professionals to join us on this exciting journey.",

I've always been dedicated to sustainable design and circular economy practices.  Having grown up in a family of architects and artists in Syria, I developed a deep appreciation for design's transformative power in shaping lives. This led to my commitment to sustainable building design methods and utilizing local and eco-friendly materials to create thriving urban spaces across various projects, from industrial buildings to educational ventures.  As an architect with SLB, I managed over $200 million worth of global projects, honing my project management skills while reinforcing my dedication to sustainability.  In my previous role as Sustainable Facility Project Manager, I played a pivotal role in developing and implementing sustainability strategies for Schlumberger's global facilities. I successfully reduced our carbon footprint by advocating for renewable energy projects and green building design, and actively engaged in CDP reporting and TCFD reporting for transparent environmental disclosures.  As Global Sourcing Manager, I now focus on transforming our supply chain with circular economy principles and sourcing from eco-friendly and socially responsible suppliers. Through careful evaluation, I ensure our sourcing aligns with sustainability objectives, fostering strong partnerships and compliance with our standards.  My unyielding passion for a sustainable future drives me to seek continuous learning and growth, staying at the forefront of sustainable practices. Each project and initiative is aimed at leaving a positive and lasting impact on the world, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future.",

      "Notes": "Seasoned professionals make better founders and their startups more likely to succeed. 👇  There is evidence to suggest that people with prior work experience are better founders. A study in the Harvard Business Review found that founders with prior work experience were more likely to succeed than those without. The study found that founders with prior work experience had a better understanding of the market, were more likely to have a strong network, and were more likely to have the skills and knowledge necessary to run a successful business. https://hbr.org/2018/07/research-the-average-age-of-a-successful-startup-founder-is-45  In addition, Founder Friendly Labs, the equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, has a great success rate. \"If you’re looking for popular accelerators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups to top the list, we’re sorry to disappoint you. According to exit rate, YC and 500 Startups are ranked 18th and 16th respectively....The four most active accelerators have an exit rate of about 10% or half that of the top ones like AngelPad, Founder Friendly Labs, and Starve Ups....Beyond individual Techstars programs like Techstars Boulder, top startup accelerators include Founder Friendly Labs (20.7%), AngelPad (20.3%), Starve Ups(17.5%), Microsoft Accelerator(16.0%), and Stanford’s StartX(14.1%).\" https://betaboom.com/blog/best-startup-accelerators/  Of course, not all founders with prior work experience are successful. There are many factors that contribute to the success of a startup, including the founder's vision, the team, the market, and the timing. However, having experience can give founders a significant advantage.  At Acquired Wisdom Fund (AWF.VC), our goal is to help seasoned professionals create scalable technology products. AWF.VC invests in early stage tech startups at the pre-seed and seed stage. As software generalists, we don't focus on any particular vertical, investing in both B2B and B2C startups. Great founders can look like anyone and come from anywhere, so startups seeking to pitch AWF.VC do not need a warm intro and can simply fill out the form on our website. https://awf.vc/  If you're considering starting a business, having prior work experience can give you a significant advantage. It's not a guarantee of success, but it can make the journey a lot easier.",

I am a self-starter and continuous learner who pairs my affinity for problem-solving and implementing lean solutions to develop and manage new, innovative ventures.  I have challenged myself to take the road less traveled and use my engineering background as a framework to explore my entrepreneurial ambitions. My career has given me diverse professional experiences which have allowed me to see the inner workings of all aspects of a business.  My path to the present day has gifted me the opportunity to raise $1.7M for a self-managed project proposal as a Systems Engineer at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky, assist in managing and growing a team of Export Compliance Specialists from <10 to 30+, collaborate with Executive Management at Lockheed Martin & Sikorsky Aircraft and manage airframe design and modification projects for the Presidential and Black Hawk Helicopter programs, as well as become a founder of a technology startup (MiP.O.V., an EvoNexus Portfolio Company), digital marketing consulting agency and e-commerce store.  I took those experiences and applied them in my career as Database Manager at AbacusNext where I directly oversaw the merger of product, sales, and marketing operations from 6 recent acquisitions into a homogenous marketing and sales operation to generate new sales qualified leads, market to an existing database of 1.5 million clients, and hit revenue goals of $200,000 in new Monthly Recurring Revenue.   I utilized my experiences from working with the early stage technology ventures to some of the world's largest corporations to pass learnings onto fellow entrepreneurs and organizations when I was the former Head Program Lead of the San Diego Chapter of Startup Leadership Program, as a current Mentor for Startup San Diego, and as a Business Coach for PLNU Undergrads.  Currently, I am the Senior Director of Programs and Healthcare Tech at Nex Cubed, a Frontier Technology Venture Studio and Seed Investor based in San Diego. I oversee 30+ portfolio companies that have raised $40M+ and represent a total enterprise value of $200M+ and have worked with clients such as GE Healthcare and the Alliance Healthcare Foundation. In addition, I am a Board Member of Point Loma Nazarene University's Marketing Advisory Board where I work with faculty leadership to provide an entrepreneurial and industry perspective to form a curriculum for students in the business school.   I am always looking to meet new people and learn about exciting opportunities in business.",

The fund is focused on companies raising “late seed” rounds, where investments will fill grant and early stage funding gaps in anticipation of a series A round within 18 to 24 months.  Founded by the USM Board of Regents with the objective to promote the economic development initiatives of the state, Momentum will give particular attention to developing the innovation ecosystem in key sectors of regional and USM institutional strength. Investments will generally range from $150,000 to $500,000, with $250,000 being the most likely sum, in the form of convertible notes or equity purchases. In all cases, an investment matching (1:1) Momentum funding must be obtained within 6 months.   A Maryland-based company is eligible if intellectual property is owned by a USM institution, the principal founder or inventor is a USM faculty, graduate, or student, or if the company is located at a USM research park, incubator, or RISE Zone.  Applications are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Eligible companies may notify the Momentum Fund of its intention to seek funding or request a meeting at any time via email.  Notices of intent may be sent to Fund Director, David W. Wise, at dwise@umaryland.edu. The review process will also require the company to create a GUST profile. Applicants who are not accepted may be held on active status and receive coaching from Momentum or USM staff to prepare the company for future consideration.

      "Notes": "Living in the United Arab Emirates for most of my adult life, has strongly shaped my personality from a social and professional point of view. Working in Dubai, in fact, has turned me into an extremely open-minded and adaptable being, while relating myself to a multitude of peers from different cultural & social background. Because of this early exposure, I have learnt to easily comply with new challenging surroundings, and understand different cultural and social realities. As a natural communicator, I love “connecting” with people: I am a team-player, but I can also work independently. I am committed and strong-willed when it comes to standing up for my ideas and those of the people I admire and respect. Two of my strongest traits are my innate attention to details – as I always focus on those aspects which are most commonly overseen by many other people, yet I find them extremely essential for achieving a top-quality work & life goals - and my dynamism - as I love to keep myself always active and prone to personal and professional growth through challenging working experiences and roles.",

At the same time, we are strongly connected to global technology trends and financial markets, which allows us to be sophisticated about our product and market decisions.  Beyond ONEs core business structure combines a strong MVNO brand portfolio & market position, a robust digital platform and reliable cash flows with a profitable growth strategy enabling new digital products & services for growth markets.  Our team is composed of founders with a deep understanding of growth economies and all of us have lived and worked in growth markets for many years.  This enables us to understand pain points in the customer journey, particularly in a context of sometimes lacking infrastructure paired with substantial increases in purchasing power/growth of consumer markets.  We have very diverse skill sets with the common denominator being our love for people, technology and growth markets. We play straight, do not kick cans down the road, we take fast decisions and are always ready to focus on solutions, not dwelling on problems. We see opportunities and not challenges. We are creative and flexible on our way to reach our goals but we are persistent and focused when it comes to our goals.",

      "Notes": "I am an entrepreneur and investor focused on building scalable mental fitness tools to improve our collective wellbeing. My passion for this space is driven by 3 core beliefs:  1. Investing into scalable mental fitness tools is the fastest way to improve the collective human condition. We cannot solve the SDGs without focusing on IDGs (Inner Development Goals)  2. Technology (and science) can greatly accelerate our mental fitness development with tools that can motivate us to do the work, train in more precise ways and better measure outcomes    3. Mental fitness will be as important to our society as physical fitness within 20-years  As an investor I run MindEd Ventures, a micro-VC-fund that has deployed $650k of capital across 15 early stage deals since Oct. 2022. We invest across 5 themes:  1. Building mental wellness measurement infrastructure 2. The future of data-driven brain training 3. Cultivating scalable peak experiences 4. Increasing access and reducing cost for mental wellness support 5. Precision wellness to improve nutrition, sleep and movement habits  As an entrepreneur,  I spent 6-years building VC-backed start-ups in East Africa (that have collectively raised $20M+ in funding). I moved back to the US in 2023 to focus on building ventures in the mental wellness space. To build my entrepreneurial intuition, I spent 6-months shadowing CEOs of 15 fast growing start-ups from pre-seed to post-IPO across Africa, Europe and the US. This has given me a unique insight into what it takes to scale start ups.  Before the startup roller-coaster, I spent 5-years at BCG focused on Consumer and Corporate Development across the US, Australia and the Nordics.",

We back founders whose mission is to supply core infrastructure and an enablement layer for this transition from Generative AI to AGI.  We believe that there will be many winners in AI--not just the handful of mega-tech firms. The quality and reliability of AI systems will not just be a function of who can amass the most raw compute. Access to non-public insights and training data will allow specialist AIs to create powerful solutions that will consistently outperform generic platforms.   We're always looking to connect with founders who see the world the way we do. ",

Prior to being Managing Partner & Founder at early growth VC firm Santa Barbara Venture Partners (and before it a Venture Partner at OCV Partners and NGEN Partners), Dan led customer acquisition for Google, GoToMeeting, Picasa, and FastSpring.   In 2005, Dan co-founded FastSpring, a Fintech SaaS firm providing e-commerce store management and payments for 3,000+ software vendors worldwide. As CEO, Dan bootstrapped FastSpring’s revenue from $0 to over $120 million using funding of $30,000. FastSpring (acquired in 2013 and then again by Accel-KKR in 2018), was known for its phenomenal customer service (4-time winner of The Silver Stevie Award for “Customer Service Department Of The Year”). It was the #1 fastest-growing company in the LA area during 2006-2010, 13th fastest-growing in N. America, and ranked 41 & 53 on the Inc 500 for 2010 & 2011. FastSpring grew during the Great Recession at a compound growth rate of over 10% per month for over three years and had an annual churn rate of 1.3% across 3,000+ software clients. The founders/original investors in FastSpring earned an ROI of over 900X on their original investment.  Prior to co-founding FastSpring, Dan led online customer acquisition/advertising for Google AdSense & AdWords through its IPO phase. Before Google, Dan was VP of Market Development at Picasa, a digital photo consumer software company sold to Google in '04 (now Google Photos). Dan led Picasa's customer acquisition & business development initiatives, growing revenue by 7x in ten months.  Previously, Dan led customer acquisition for GoToMeeting & GoToMyPC software, generating tens of millions in revenue over a 2-year period, helping lead to a $225M acquisition by Citrix in '03 & building a major online brand. In '16, the GoToMeeting division generated over $600M in recurring SaaS revenue and was acquired by LogMeIn for $1.8 billion.   At 24, Dan was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Idealab, the #1 .com incubator, after starting a consumer e-commerce company in college. He graduated Tulane majoring in Finance in 1998. Dan has appeared in various publications, including Entrepreneur, Forbes & the WSJ, and serves on various for and non-profit (homelessness) director/advisor boards.

      "Notes": "\"If you do not work on important problems, you will not do important work.”  I invest in outstanding climatetech companies.    I enjoyed every minute of 15 years in leadership roles in climatetech (and biotech) businesses spanning VP Sales at Tesla, VP Operations at Sunrun, GM Energy at Yardi Systems, and launch PM for a new product at Genentech.  But it's not my personality to do one thing. As a partner to founders, I get to be involved in many exciting moments of a company's journey. I love working with founders to help them build enduring, iconic, and profitable companies that will drive massive improvement in human civilization and for all life on earth.  I invest in climatetech because I'm passionate about not just disrupting the world, but improving it. I believe climate change is the greatest challenge human civilization has faced, that the struggle to control fossil fuels is a major obstacle to worldwide peace and prosperity, and that environmental degradation is a massive drag on human health and well-being. I think harnessing the power of capitalism will lead to the most effective solutions so I approach these problems through business and technology.  I also know that solving climate will have innumerable \"side effects\" which will improve life in vast and powerful ways...while nurturing the planet we all love and need.    Trivia:  When I was kid, my phone number was just 4 digits.  *The quote above is from Richard Hamming.

      "Notes": "I love being with customers and partners and working on solving key problems.  I love \"figuring things out.\"  As such, I want to invest in and mentor companies that have clearly solved a problem for a consumer or business.  As a Venture Partner, I love discovering new companies to support.  When I work as a Fractional Operating Partner to Venture firms or Family Offices, or as an Advisor, I am focused on mentoring and advising early-stage, growth companies.  The perfect fit is a combination of the two - working with Venture or PE investors on their portfolio companies, leveraging 30 years of operational experience across a myriad of technologies in both Saas and hardware and both B2C/Retail and B2B.  My underlying passions are global expansion and broad GTM strategy, especially building partner/reseller channels, as each of these themes have permeated my entire career.  I am not afraid to take a risk. Early stage companies go through a lot of change and I have seen A LOT. Seeking Product Market Fit (PMF) is hard. Most recently I led global sales of AI-based robotics at Sarcos (STRC)- the most advanced commercial Exoskeletons and outdoor and Sub Sea robots in the world. Previously, I led Global Sales for Magic Leap, the leader in Spatial Computing/AR (with Apple Vision Pro now giving everyone new hope).  There were challenges and plenty of learning experiences in both that I can leverage to help other companies.  On a larger scale, I also built from scratch the Enterprise Sales team at Unity, the world leader in 3D real-time rendering, Real-time 3D, VR and AR, etc., and I led global Marketing at Microsoft for Mixed Reality (HoloLens and VR), in addition to previous roles in 3D/lightfield imaging and enterprise-oriented VR and AR companies.   I have been an investor and entrepreneur and consultant to entrepreneurs, so I know how hard business can actually be in the start-up phase. I have been a Board member for several CPG companies, and have held roles in international sales, channel and product marketing, business development, e-commerce, and global supply chain.  Specialties: Saas Sales, Metaverse, Spatial Computing, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, HoloLens, Augmented Reality, Gaming accessories, licensing, international sales and marketing, retail/channel management, and product dev.    *Note: If you want to connect, I normally reject the template Invites - 2 minutes explaining shows you care.*  I will NOT respond to Personal Financial Advisor solicitations, franchising business inquiries, or the latest trend - \"executive health coaching.\"  #metaverse",

I managed teams between 15-35, and I come with technical, entrepreneurial, and active VC investing experience.  I believe VC is becoming more science than art, more quantitative than qualitative. I think every VC needs to get operational experience in a data role to better understand and analyze data, and become more data-driven.  To act on this belief, and after 8 years of active venture experience, I joined a SaaS FinTech startup (Carta) for 3 years as a data scientist, then I moved to another FinTech startup (KingsCrowd) applying my data skills to aggregate, analyze, score, and rate private markets deal flow: pre-seed to pre-IPO, from 70+ online private markets (e.g., SeedInvest, Republic, WeFunder, StartEngine) and provide both retail investors and institutions actionable investment insights.  I'm also a believer in decentralized finance and decentralized capital management, and now I'm focusing on building & investing-in #DeFi, #Blockchain, #FinTech, #Web3, #Crypto, and #AI products.   I am a ​Kauffman Fellow​, a VC blogger (​VCpreneur.com​), an Electronics Engineer with an MBA from NYiT, and I come with technical & entrepreneurial experience, and more than 8 years of active VC investing in Seed and Series A & B Startups. I also went to Harvard for executive training on venture capital and private equity.   I am a math lover, and my passion for product and analytics led me to enroll in Udacity's Data Analyst and then Data Scientist Nano Degrees to learn: R,  Python (Numpy and Pandas), Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras), SQL, Looker, Mode Analytics, and Tableau.   Lately, I've enrolled in UC Berkeley FinTech Bootcamp 2023, which includes courses on Data Science, AI, & ML Applications in both: Traditional Financial technology programming (Web2 & CeFi), and Decentralized Financial technology programming (DeFi, Blockchain, Web3, & Smart Contracts). In this bootcamp I learned about: Solidity, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Near, Smart Contracts, Consensus Algorithms, Transactions Validation, Distributed Ledger, Cryptocurrency, Truffle Suite, Ganache and many other cool tech.",

We are committed to making a positive impact and for us, that means using our business as a force for good, in whatever way we can. We commit to donating 5% of our revenue to charities that share our beliefs and we hope to play our part in driving affirmative action. It might not be a lot, but it’s certainly a start. We have incorporated UNSDG5 into our business model and provide favourable terms to businesses seeking to balance gender and empower females in their leadership teams.  Ben has a long-established reputation working with some of the best-known retailers and consumer tech platforms across D2C, marketplaces, subscription based, and rental. He has a broad functional understanding but a bias towards fashion, food, and non-food categories as well as health and wellness brands in the United States and EMEA regions. He has a specific passion for partnering with brands with a social conscience and purpose and partners closely with B Corp certified businesses and brands with sustainability at the core.  Ben has developed an extensive network built on trust and delivery among CEO's, Founders and Investors, allowing his partners access to the best talent globally. In addition to traditional search, Ben has delivered successful talent mapping and pipeline projects on behalf of global retailers and brands. With a very current industry overview, he has built relationships through his knowledge and flexibility. Ben has been fortunate enough to be involved in significant leadership change as well as building future talent mapping strategies on behalf of companies where sustainability and digital transformation has been a constant theme.   Graduating with a BA Hons in Political Science Ben spent time working at Constituent and Parliamentary level shadowing a prominent UK Member of Parliament. In his spare time, he is still trying to master the game of golf, is a keen follower of Manchester City F.C, and balances his healthy obsession of food with a passion for fitness. Ben's paternal grandparents emigrated from Pakistan in the 1960s where they settled in Manchester and made it their new home. Proud of his own ethnically diverse background, he leads from the front to ensure that all his search mandates are inclusive and diverse with particular consideration towards cognitive diversity as a measure for future leadership success in the boardroom.  e: ben@mccabeandpartners.com",

At B10 Capital, we understand the years, months, weeks, days and hours of work and sacrifice that go into building a substantial foundation of assets. Because of this, we have worked tirelessly to assemble programs, products and partnerships that honor your efforts.  B10 Capital focuses on two qualities that we have found to be essential in any company interested in sustaining above-average growth and success. Liquidity and flexibility. As you know, readily available liquidity (debt or equity) is needed for all businesses. We can help you find either the debt or equity that you need. Whether it is to get the business started by financing equipment or inventory or to help cover payroll in a pinch, B10 has the relationships and resources to assist.  When you want liquidity from the sale of an asset, a traditional 1031 Exchange may not be the best answer and the sale of private equity doesn't qualify anymore. When you have substantial taxable income, deliberate planning (both PROactive and REactive) is your only intelligent approach. \"We'll just see how it shakes out\" is an inexcusable strategy.  B10 is about relationships. We have created a national (and international, as well) network of strategic partners with varied and diverse sets of skills so that we can analyze your situation quickly to help you maximize your profits, liquidity and cash flow. We look forward to meeting you and beginning a mutually beneficial relationship. Please contact your B10 Capital Regional Director to learn more about what we offer and how we can help you.  ",

      "Description": "We help entrepreneurs form new teams and build AI-first startups.  We bring together world-class engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs to create new companies together from scratch. We help them come up with ideas, find co-founders, engage pilot customers, define their product, incorporate the latest A.I. techniques into their technology, and raise millions of dollars in venture funding.  Over the last six years, we have created 20+ companies that are collectively worth $750M+ in valuation, have collectively raised $150M+ in venture funding, and have collectively created 500+ jobs. Even more impressively, more than half of that growth occurred in the last year.  But beneath those numbers, the missions of those companies are even more important. These startups are helping immigrants to improve their communication skills (Yoodli), helping scientists to significantly accelerate cancer research (Ozette and Modulus), helping A.I. practitioners monitor critical algorithms in the wild (WhyLabs), helping business ops and legal teams to be much more efficient (Lexion), helping millions of creators to more easily produce voice content (WellSaid), turning your smartphone into a powerful medical device (MeasureLabs), and so much more.   Our unique advantages come from our core team's expertise and our exclusive partnership with the Paul Allen Institute for A.I. (aka \"AI2\"). Created in 2014 by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, AI2 has 200+ PhDs, researchers, engineers, professors, and support staff—and is well known for its contributions to the A.I. research community including 600+ papers, 20+ best paper awards, and numerous products/open source offerings including SemanticScholar, AllenNLP, and more.

Professional Milestones:  * Led ad product initiatives at Reddit, gaining insights into consumer behavior and community dynamics.  * Co-founded Appstores, acquired by InMobi, and was instrumental in developing their Native Ads product.  * At Facebook, as an early member of the Platform team, I collaborated with major partners such as Disney, Hulu, and Spotify.  * Initiated the integration of Facebook Connect and developed social applications at Dotspotter, later acquired by CBS Interactive.  My strength lies in bridging Product and Engineering, offering a unique perspective that has proven invaluable to companies I've worked with, advised, and invested in.

I have over 12 years of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, having founded two startups and supported several others in various industries. My first startup, Oh My Glasses, is one of the largest eyeglasses e-commerce platforms in Japan, and my second startup, Machimachi, is a social network for neighborhoods with 3 million monthly active users and a business alliance with more than 130 local governments.

Since inception, we have positioned dedicated teams of highly skilled specialists in each market, creating a superior library of market specific data.

      "Notes": "Hi,  Mike Jarmuz… or Muzz…  that's me... a General Partner at Lightning⚡️Ventures, and I'm focused on investing in Bitcoin companies. I aim to evangelize and demystify early-stage investing to plebs and whales alike. I'm super passionate about educating founders and operators on strategies to fund their projects. I believe everyone should invest in technology companies (not just the suits) and that investing in Bitcoin companies is possibly the best thing someone can do to complement their HODL position. What else? I am also an advisor to Azteco, Slice, Cloaked Wireless, and Satoshi Money.   I have a serious angel investing addiction and have invested in over 1500 companies. I am creating a dataset and investment strategy I have appropriately titled \"Piking.\"  There is no royal pedigree or Ivy League education here. We have invested in about ~30 Bitcoin companies through Lightning⚡️Ventures, and I have invested in many more. If you want to learn more about funding your rad Bitcoin company or get started investing, chat me up. ✌️  I'm a music business veteran with 10+ years in various areas of the industry. As an Independent concert promoter in multiple southwest US markets, I had a blast. Owned, operated, and worked with countless indie record labels, developing artists over the years. Partner of Boxcar Music Management (The Format) on Elektra/WEA. Co-Founder of AMJ Concerts. I was previously a partner at CAP Concerts (Corey Adams Presents) and the World Famous NILE THEATRE (Mesa, AZ). Former General Manager and Booking Agent for Modified Arts Venue & Gallery (Phoenix, AZ).   I am a lifelong entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in a broad range of industries. Lover of all small businesses! I have personally owned a retail clothing store, flower shop, bar, cafe, and music venue. I also have related experience in healthcare technology, event management, ticketing, nightlife, venue/theatre operations, talent buying, concert & music production, sound engineering, lighting design, catering, travel, tour management, e-commerce, screen-printing, merchandising, real estate, transportation, grassroots marketing, personal finance, marketing, and business consulting.

After studying in Switzerland and London, I worked in Hotel Asset Management and have established analytical skills, excel proficiency, hotel forecasting, ESG+R and valuation expertise. Before that, I was a Learning and Development Intern in Dubai and the Maldives. During that time, I developed skills in talent management, presenting, employee training, problem-solving and communication.  To deepen and expand my knowledge of the hotel real estate industry, I'm currently enrolled in the E-Cornell Hotel Real Estate Investments and Asset Management Certificate.  Through working in Hong Kong, Dubai, Maldives, and Germany over the last 5 years, I have been able to appreciate the nuances of each culture and learn to adjust and adapt to different environments. I have also gained a deeper understanding of the differences between them, allowing me to better appreciate each country's unique qualities. Furthermore, I have developed a deep understanding of the various managerial decisions and behaviour traits in each country, ultimately improving my cross-cultural communication skills. Changing my environment regularly empowered me to learn faster, grow and constantly push myself outside of my comfort zone, which motivates me. Furthermore, I have a background in various departments and asset categories (Boutique Lifestyle Hotel, Modern & Classic 5* City Hotels and Resort and Serviced Apartment), which helps me to understand different operation structures.

We understand where you are because we've been there too, which is why we formed Seed Round Capital, offering early-stage funding and fundraising support to help you turn your startup into the thriving company you envisioned when you began.  Most tech company founders fail on their way to Series A funding because of poor decision-making and lack of direction. They may not even realize some of the mistakes they are making. Seed Round Capital’s personalized guidance provides expert advising so startups can raise the money they need, enjoy their journeys, and see exponential growth.  As an early-stage startup founder you're likely overwhelmed by concerns about running out of money, letting people down and losing your dream. You need cash and customers and can only survive without both of these for so long. Having a great product, some paying customers and working hard have gotten you to this point, but you know you need to take a more formal approach to increase your chances of raising money and being successful.  As a startup, it can be very difficult to find the training, funding and support you need to succeed as a business, making you wonder why you even started the business in the first place. At Seed Round Capital we can provide that support you need to become the successful tech company CEO you aspire to be.",

After his tenure as a founding team member at WeWork, where he played a crucial role in the company's expansion, Jesse made a transition to venture capital. As a General Partner at Flybridge, a seed-stage venture capital firm for ambitious founders leveraging the power of community, he has become a trusted investor and board member to numerous startups around the world.  With a keen eye for innovative ideas and promising startups, Jesse has backed over fifty pre-seed and seed stage companies during his time as an angel investor and his tenure at Flybridge. His investment focus centers on the future of work, emphasizing areas such as creativity, culture, collaboration, and communication. By strategically investing in and supporting companies that align with these themes, Jesse aims to contribute to the evolution of how we work and interact over the next decade and beyond.  Furthermore, Jesse's commitment to the startup ecosystem extends beyond his role at Flybridge. Jesse built and supported a community of thousands of founders in WeWork Labs across NYC, SF, LA, and beyond. During his time as an angel investor, he served as an advisor to several early-stage technology startups, providing them with valuable guidance and support. Notable ventures in which he played an advisory role include fitmob (acquired by ClassPass), inDinero, Jackpocket, Squire, and YourTrove (acquired by LiveNation).  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Jesse takes pride in his role as a devoted father to an exceptional and curious child born on Leap Day in 2016. In 2022, he married Catherine, and the couple eagerly awaits the arrival of their next child, expected at the end of 2023.",

Identify the target audience they wish to influence. 2. Uncover the core message needed to position them as an “authority” in the minds of that specific audience. 3. Identify the right authority platforms to increase their credibility and influence. 4. Make it happen.  However, this is “not” for everyone ...  WHO THIS IS FOR - I work primarily with \"C\" suite executives in the pre-IPO or exit stage, wanting to take their business up a couple of steps, wishing to focus energy on the right things and build a strong repeatable, sustainable and profitable business.  If you’re already great at what you do, and you want to position your authority to support your greater mission, then this is PERFECT for you.  If you are an executive (usually within the \"C\" suite) and you want to Up-level your visibility and that of your team - this is definitely for you.  If you are too busy building your business to think about visibility or credibility, we are a great solution for you. Time is not recoverable.  HOW IT WORKS:   1 - We jump on a quick “discovery” call to find out IF and HOW we can help you, and mutually decide if there’s a fit for us to work together.  2 – IF there is a fit, and we believe you have what it takes, we MAY offer to work with you.  3 – IF we choose to work with you, we will hold you accountable and guide you through our process for creating visibility, credibility and influence while driving top level strategic plans- building reputation capital!

In most cases, this means a focus on US market entry from day one.  Outstanding founding teams with domain expertise. We believe that great founders are the main driver of success for any entrepreneurial venture. We like \"well-rounded\"​ founders, but tend to prefer founders that are \"angular,\"​ bringing unique technical or domain expertise to bear.  Early stage. We like to be very early. We are not religious about being first, but most of our investments are into companies that have raised less than $1M before we engage. ",

Early on in her career, Diane founded and bootstrapped a Manhattan-based commercial real estate company working with CEOs and startup founders across industries, achieving profitability within 6 months despite a global financial crisis. Shortly after, she launched Rogue Capital Collective, a thesis-driven seed investment firm creating funding opportunities for high-potential, under the radar, early-stage startups, which included increasing capital access for underrepresented founders.   One of her core strengths lies in uncovering pre-market opportunities that yield fast and significant return. Her most recent success driving executive strategy for a 9-figure impact fund speaks to her unique mix of business acumen, expertise in capital deployment, high-stakes investment decision-making, deal structuring, and negotiation, and keen eye for recruiting and developing top talent. She has led diligence for software startups and hard tech companies alike, bringing valuable proprietary insights to drive sustainable growth.

I have been a key member of executive management teams that have created billions in shareholder value and thousands of jobs, and contributed as a C-suite officer to the creation and growth of some of technology's most profitable and best-loved brands - PayPal, eBay, and Sonos.  Throughout my career, I have established a strong track record of creating financial frameworks and leading financial operations for Fortune 500 companies and for rapidly growing startups. I have gained specific expertise in creating protocols that meet regulatory requirements, assisting startups in navigating daunting IPO and SOX compliance plans, and guiding organizations through the entire lifecycle of mergers, acquisitions, and integrations.  I am passionate about helping those I partner with to excel and surpass expectations - from inspiring direct reports and investors to take action to challenging partners to deliver world-class products and services.   A few of my career highlights include:  * Led the creation and implementation of financial operating and compliance processes for PayPal and eBay.   * Leveraged regulatory and industry knowledge to advise multiple startups through IPO and SOX compliance processes.  * Spearheaded successful $650M financing campaign across syndicate of 12 banks for CAN Capital, Inc.   * Established FP&A team for Sonos, Inc. (NASDAQ : SONO) including identifying and recruiting top talent to build a well-rounded unit. ",

I have over a decade of startup investing and over 70 investments. Initially a generalist, then specialized in Edtech, currently investing in Proptech & Construction tech. Always eager to embrace new opportunities.   I believe in platforms. When I launched industry verticals for Dreamit, I built the broad networks of hundreds of venture investors and potential customer partners. I then wrapped those networks in process with the Customer Sprint and Investor Sprint programs that I helped design to help my portfolio companies raise funds and close sales far more effectively than informal, ad hoc introductions.    I have worked closely with dozens of corporate innovation groups and CVCs and consult for developers, general contractors, large landlords, etc. on what works (or more often, does not work) and how to design a corporate venture structure that takes full advantage of the potential power in this platform.   I also believe in maintaining a strong personal platform. I regularly write for startup and trade press with well over 60 published articles in Fortune, Forbes, AlleyWatch, Propmodo, CREtech, BUILDER Online, Multifamily Executive, Architect Magazine, Edsurge, The 74 Million, etc. and I am a frequent conference speaker & panelist throughout the US & abroad (e.g., S.

      "Notes": "It all started with brownies and baseball cards. Then came lemonade and a larger card table. Before long, my 8-year old sidewalk empire had a formal pricing scheme, two part-time employees (my parents), and even a few not-so-hostile acquisitions.   Fourteen years later, after a surprisingly successful Beanie Babies business and Pokémon coding company in middle school, I sold my second (real) business. In many ways, Puppystock (2005-2007) was the natural extension of my neighborhood dessert and card dealing business. While my co-founder and I eventually grew our tiny little online store into a multi-million dollar company and disrupted how pet products were sold, we were soon distracted by the shine of a new idea. Before we sold Puppystock, we had already started on FriendTones (2007-2008) – a mobile social networking and technology company intertwined with the new Facebook application market. Although one of our applications became the Napster of ringtones (when people actually used ringtones), I still use pieces of our technology every day with my phone, and so do you.    By 2008, ringtones had lost their popularity and I had moved on to designing, creating, and managing three analytics programs for Director-level personnel at two Intelligence agencies (CIA & NGA). From 2011-2013, I acquired experience at a family investment office and worked on the full lifecycle of multiple US-based venture capital deals with a prominent angel investor. From 2013-2014, I dually completed a full-time MBA program and co-founded a new family office that managed alternative investment funds for a very wealthy family abroad (and became an international tax expert).  Now, I’ve found my next lemonade stand – with the opportunity to leverage my experiences as a serial entrepreneur, (former) tornado chaser turned venture capitalist at Early Light Ventures. ",

Our investment strategy is to identify and invest in well-known, fast-growing technology companies around the world. We focus on large, rapidly expanding projects with valuations typically above $500 million and the potential for at least 100% year-over-year growth. Our goal is to identify these companies early on and be a part of their growth journey.  Industry focus: fintech, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, foodtech, neobanking, e-commerce, mobile apps, SaaS, software.  Target investment period: from 12 to 36 months  The main criteria for the selection of companies:  ●  The company's valuation begins at $500 million. ●  Business has seen a growth of at least 300% on average over the last three years. ●  The total amount of venture funding raised starts at $100 million. ●  Notable venture capital funds are among the investors. ●  Valuation has the potential to increase by at least 100% per year.  We only consider projects that have already received investment from top-tier venture capital companies and we compare our own analysis to the expert evaluations of industry leaders.  Advantages of the Veligera Capital Fund: ●  In-depth expertise of companies: the fund's analysts carefully examine the activities of candidate companies, selecting the most promising and sustainable ones. ●  It is easy to assemble a diversified portfolio: investment proposals from the fund come out every month. ●  It is convenient to manage investments: a personal account on the website and a separate account inside the fund for each investor. ●  Based on the provided analytics, the investor independently decides to participate in the transaction recommended by the fund or reject the offer.",

Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for managing operations across both corporate and startup environments, as well as for driving innovation and digital solutions strategies alike.   I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to growth and expansion throughout my career, including having my last company named a top global partner of the US Government.   Professional focal points also include team and project leadership, business strategy, tech tools and emerging technologies, speaking engagements, and numerous facets of early-stage investments, crowdfunding, and investor management. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective listening and speaking skills, financial services expertise, as well as resource management to support efficiency and maximum results. This led to two expert witness testimonies in US Congress on financial regulation, innovation, and investment as well as providing workshops for FINRA.  I currently serve as the Managing Partner at Stacked Capital. Under my leadership, I oversee investment functions for an early-stage institutional venture fund, which includes sourcing, diligence, investment structuring, portfolio alignment, and the creation, identification, and investment into accelerators and incubators. I have also received recognition for providing mentorship and operational support to investments. In addition, I liaise with senior leadership and departmental teams to ensure the company’s support structure is driving business forward with minimal expenditures.  Colleagues depict me as a progressive, motivated, and effective expert in financial and technical administration as well as creative and strategic problem resolutions, relied upon to provide solutions that yield positive results.

We focus on the early stages of industries that change the world, including generative AI, consumer APPs,  BCI, and blockchain.
